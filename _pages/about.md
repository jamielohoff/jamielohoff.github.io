**CV**: <br>
Currently doing a PhD in Neuromorphic Computing and Artificial Intelligence at RWTH Aachen and Jülich Research Center. It's a lot of fun!<br>


# The Scientific Me
I am yet another physicist who left the field because auf the Neuroscience and AI hype. 
This however does not mean that I have given up on all the physics and math; quite the contrary actually.
What intrigues me about Neuroscience and AI is the lack of good foundational theory that allows us to truly understand what makes animals, humans and machines intelligent.
Is intelligence an emergent property that results from scaling up? Is it the connectome of the network that matters? Or is it the computational substrate itself?<br>
My guess would be that it is a superposition of all these effects, but we don't know yet how to combine these ingredients in a systematic way.
I believe that insights from mathematics, physics, control theory and electrical engineering can be of help there.
I am particularly interested in applying methods from Statistical Physics and Differential Geometry to these problems an see how far I can get with that.

Apart from these very theoretical considerations, I am also a big fan of actually building cool and useful things, which is also why I want to understand Neuroscience and AI better in the first place. I am convinced that we can only build cooler and better stuff if we really understand what we are doing.

**Neuroscience-inspired** stuff that I had the pleasure to work with:
- Event-based cameras that work like the human retina
- Various SNNs with event-based and frame-based datasets
- Spiking neural network accelerators aka. silicon brains (BrainScalesS, Speck, DynapCNN)
- BPTT, RTRL, E-Prop, Event-Prop and all the other famous learning rules

**Deep Learning** stuff that I have enjoyed working with so far:
- Transformers (who hasn't though...)
- Reinforcement Learning, in particular PPO and AlphaZero
- Neural Differential Equations, although it is just the Pontryagin Principle from Control Theory at work
- All the default AI stuff like CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, MLPs, ResNets

**Physics** stuff that I came across which is not in the default curriculum:
- Cosmology, Quintessence models, Brans-Dicke, Sting Theory
- Infrared telescopy, especially the trajectory of the star S2 orbiting the Milkyway Central Blackhole
- Quantum Field Theory, although the Renormalization of QED is still kind of a crazy thing to me, Symmetry-breaking and Goldstone Bosons are a cool though
- Topological Edge States, Topological Insulators, Topological QFT, but only the basics
- Differential Geometry and Topology (my favorite math topics, only non-standard for a physicist)
- Quantum Information Theory, but never used a real quantum computer

Stuff that is on my **To-Learn** list:
- Physical Computing, e.g. memristors, coupled systems of spins, computing with lasers and non-linear optics etc.
- Neuroscience, especially wet-ware computing, i.e. use actual biological substrates to do stuff (I am dreaming of a GPU that literally lives inside my PC)
- Brain-Machine Interfaces, controlling of prosthetics
- Robotics, in particular drones and submarines
- Compute-in-Memory Architectures


**Favorite Scientists**:
1.) Kurt Gödel: He is king, for obvious reasons...
2.) Wolfgang Pauli: Party hard, think harder...
3.) 
 

# The Interesting Me
**Controversial Opinions**
- Jax >> PyTorch
- Linux > Mac >> Windows
- Children should learn how to code in school and there should be more focus on statistics and rational decision-making.
- Teachers/Professors are very much responsible for students liking (or disliking) a particular field and their subsequent success.
- AI has already taken over the world, but much more subtle than most people think and it is even worse than an all out "Matrix" or "Terminator" style plot.
- It is going to be a long way until we have self-aware machines with their own free will (if it exists...)

  
**Hobbies**:
- Hiking, Bouldering and Rock Climbing
- Everying that goes fast and is dangerous, e.g. cars, motorcycles, skiing, mountain biking
- Woodworking and Guitar
